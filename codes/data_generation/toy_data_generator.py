'''
This script will generate two sets of toy data. One with more and one with less dots.
author: Maximilian Otto, 2022, maxotto45@gmail.com
Generate some matrices. The numbers in it represent the size of each dot 
Pseudocode:
[x] 1. Initialize matrix with zeros
[x] 2. for each cell in matrix:
[x]    2. Assign value through random function with given probaility (e.g. 0.3 vs. 0.5)
[x]    3. Value = random[ 0, 1] with given probability (e.g. 0.1)
[x]       if value == 1:
[x]          value = [ 0 : (dist_to_nearest_neighbor) - value.nearest_neighbor]
[x] - plot the matrix (matplotlib). The numvber in each cell is the size of the dot to plot 
[ ] - TODO: Keep the Distances (+sizes) of each dot to another in a list and save teh list for all images while generating. 
        - This will be used to compare the mean distance and shortest path of teh two datasets (e.g. for the distance metric and to find a statistical significant difference)
        - further, this statistic will be used to compare the obtrained ground-truth with what the network learned.
